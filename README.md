- 👋 Hi, I’m @truthfulsammy
- 👀 I write and test ethereum, bnb, trx, polygon smart contracts for a living
- 🌱 I’m currently working on a smart contract that prevents unauthorised withdrawal from other smart contracts
- 💞️ I work alone but I have my own community of programmers to assist me in programming
- 📫 Reach me on Telegram @pribacyreload for smart contracts and bots. 
- NOTE: I don't come free but everything I give you comes with a tutorial on how to use them. I would do almost anything for the right price but your anonymity is assured.

<!---
truthfulsammy/truthfulsammy is a ✨ special ✨ repository because it doesn't cotain the programmer's code, only a README text for each code.
Reach me on Telegram for the actual code and tutorial
